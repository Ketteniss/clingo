1.  ->  it must be possible to get from any white cell 
        to any other white cell by moving only horizontally 
        and vertically (never diagonally!), and without 
        having to cross a black cell.

2.  ->  A number in a circle indicates how 
        many of the 4 adjacent cells must be blackened.
